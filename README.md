WaT
===

Work-in-progress drop-in WakaTime replacement.

**NOTE:** WaT is still in early phases of development, nothing is final yet.

Demo(incomplete) version is running at https://wat.iptq.io.

Why?
----

I've nothing against WakaTime, and I'm personally very grateful for the community they've built around tracking coding statistics. But at the end of the day, I'd like to keep my own data, and hopefully you do too. This project gives you the option to host a WakaTime-compatible server while allowing you to continue using the great plugins that people have developed for WakaTime.

Usage
